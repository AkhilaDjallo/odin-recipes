      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large pot, bring the water to a rolling boil. Add the salt and
          spaghetti, and cook for 8-10 minutes or until al dante.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over
          medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes (if using), and cook
          for 1-2 minutes or until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drain the spaghetti, reserving 1 cup of the pasta water. Add the
          spaghetti to the skillet with the garlic and oil, and toss to coat. If
          the pasta seems dry, add some of the reserved pasta water a little at
          a time until the desired consistency is reached.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the skillet from the heat, and add the Parmesan cheese, tossing
          again to combine. Serve hot and enjoy!
