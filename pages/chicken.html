        This delicious garlic butter chicken recipe is quick and easy to make,

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>
          Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the
          chicken breasts to the skillet and cook for 5-6 minutes per side, or
          until golden brown and cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside on a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced
          garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the chicken broth to the skillet and stir to combine. Cook for 2-3
          minutes, or until the liquid has reduced by half. Add the heavy cream
          and Parmesan cheese to the skillet and stir until the sauce is smooth
          and creamy. Return the chicken to the skillet and coat it in the
          garlic butter sauce. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve hot.
