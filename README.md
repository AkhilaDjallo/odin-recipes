# odin-recipes

Basic Recipe Website
I am creating a simple recipe website using HTML. It will include a main index page with links to three different recipe pages. The purpose of this project is to practice my HTML skills from what i learned from the basic HTML Odin-Project website, with the intention of styling the website using CSS in the future.

Project Structure
The project will be structured as follows:

odin-recipes/

- index.html
- spaghetti.html
- brownies.html
- chicken.html
- README.md

index.html: The main index page of the website, which includes links to each of the three recipes.
spaghetti.html, brownies.html, and chicken.html: Individual recipe pages for each of the three recipes.

README.md: This file, which provides an overview of the project and its structure.

What I Will Learn
By creating this project, I will practice the following HTML concepts already learned from the basic HTML Odin-Project website :

Creating a basic HTML file structure
Adding headings, paragraphs, and links to HTML pages
Creating lists to display information
Including images in HTML pages
Structuring and organizing content on a webpage
Creating hyperlinks to navigate between pages
Usage

To use the website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. From there, you can click on the links to each recipe to view the individual recipe pages.
