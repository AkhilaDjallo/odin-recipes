# The Odin Recipes Project

Basic Recipe Website:
I am creating a simple recipe website using HTML and CSS. It includes a main index page with links to three different recipe pages, and is intended to practice my HTML and CSS skills learned from the basic HTML and CSS sections of the Odin Project.

Project Structure:
The project is structured as follows:

- odin-recipes/

  index.html

  spaghetti.html

  brownies.html

  chicken.html

- images/
  brownies.jpg
  chicken.jpg
  hybrid.jpg
  spaghetti.jpg

- styles/

  index.css
  style.css

- README.md

index.html: The main index page of the website, which includes links to each of the three recipes.

spaghetti.html, brownies.html, and chicken.html: Individual recipe pages for each of the three recipes.

styles/index.css: The base CSS file for the website, which includes common styles for all pages.

styles/style.css: The CSS file specific to the recipe pages, which includes styles for the individual recipe pages.

images/: A directory containing the image files for the recipes.

README.md: This file, which provides an overview of the project and its structure.

What I Will Learn:
By creating this project, I will practice the following HTML and CSS concepts already learned from the basic HTML and CSS sections of the Odin Project:

- Creating a basic HTML file structure
- Adding headings, paragraphs, and links to HTML pages
- Creating lists to display information
- Including images in HTML pages
- Structuring and organizing content on a webpage
- Creating hyperlinks to navigate between pages
- Styling web pages using CSS
- Creating CSS rules and classes
- Using CSS selectors to target HTML elements

Usage:
To use the website, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. From there, you can click on the links to each recipe to view the individual recipe pages, which will be styled using the CSS files.
